                        <p>History changed on October 4, 1957, when the Soviet Union successfully launched Sputnik I.<BR><BR> The world's first artificial satellite was about the size of a beach ball (58 cm.or 22.8 inches in diameter), weighed only 83.6 kg. or 183.9 pounds, and took about 98 minutes to orbit Earth on its elliptical path. That launch ushered in new political, military, technological, and scientific developments. While the Sputnik launch was a single event, it marked the start of the space age and the U.S.-U.S.S.R space race.<br>

And that’s not likely to change any time soon. Although Vanguard stopped communicating with Earth in 1964, it will remain in orbit for centuries to come.

Zond 5 carried the first terrestrial organisms to the vicinity of the Moon, including two tortoises, fruit fly eggs, and plants.<br><br> The Russian tortoises underwent biological changes during the flight, but it was concluded that the changes were primarily due to starvation and that they were little affected by space travel.</p>
